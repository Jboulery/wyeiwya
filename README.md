## Introduction

What you eat is who you are ! Ever wonder which country eats the healthiest food ? You're going on a trip to Phillipines and you worry that you won't be able to keep on with your diet ? This data visualization project will give you all the answers.

Based on a database provided by [OpenFoodFacts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/), we created a D3 visualization that allows you to see which country in the world eats the fattest food or the sweetest one, and much more features.

## Data source

The original dataset and problem comes from [this Kaggle topic](https://www.kaggle.com/openfoodfacts/world-food-facts). Basically, [OpenFoodFacts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) provides a large dataset supplemented by various users, consisting of 
food products from all round the world. For each product, there are a lot of fields and attributes that reflect its nutrionnal values, its name, its labels, nutrition score, additives, etc...

Out of all of those, we only kept 15 fields, including the origin of the product, its energy, and its main nutritional values per 100 grams.
